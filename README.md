## Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Domenico

I'm a PhD candidate at the [CIMIL](https://www.cimil.disi.unitn.it/) working on AI and music.

My research is on Deep Learning on embedded computers for:
- ðŸŽ¸ Real-time **Guitar technique recognition** 
- ðŸŽ¸ðŸŽ¹ Real-time and offline **Emotion Recognition from improvised music**

I'm passionate about *audio programming* (I've been coding JUCE plugins for embedded Elk OS for ~3 years) and would like to get more into DSP and audio plugin development.

More info about my work on my [website](https://www.domenicostefani.com/about.html).

I also love to play guitars and twist knobs on synths like I know what I'm doing ðŸŽ›ðŸŽ¹
