## Hi 👋 I'm Dom (Domenico)

I'm a post-doctoral researcher working on AI and Music at the [CIMIL](https://www.cimil.disi.unitn.it/), University of Trento. Italy 🇮🇹.

Some of my recent research projects are:
- 🎸 Neural Modeling of multiple Guitar Effects at once with control conditioning from a smooth latent/vector space ([morphdrive repo](https://github.com/domenicostefani/morphdrive)),
- 🪐 6-degrees-of-freedom Spatial Audio VST plugin development ([MCFX-6DoFconv repo](https://github.com/domenicostefani/6DoF-SpatialAudioConvolver)),
- 🎻 An AI music improviser based on extended playing techniques that duets with a double bass player ([esteso](https://github.com/domenicostefani/esteso)),
- 🎹 Deep Learning on embedded computers for  Real-time and offline **Emotion Recognition from improvised music**,
- 🎸 Deep Learning on embedded computers for  Real-time **Guitar technique recognition**

I'm passionate about music, *audio software development* and have been coding C++ JUCE plugins since 2020.

I also love to play the guitar and twist knobs on synths like I know what I'm doing 🎛🎹
