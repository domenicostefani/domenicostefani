## Hi 👋 I'm Domenico

I'm a post-doctoral researcher working on AI and music at the [CIMIL](https://www.cimil.disi.unitn.it/), University of Trento. Italy 🇮🇹.

My current projects are:
- 🎸 Deep Learning on embedded computers for  Real-time **Guitar technique recognition** 
- 🎸🎹 Deep Learning on embedded computers for  Real-time and offline **Emotion Recognition from improvised music**
- 🪐 Spatial Audio VST plugin [development](https://github.com/domenicostefani/mcfx-mod) 

I'm passionate about *audio programming* (I've been coding JUCE plugins for embedded Elk OS for ~3 years) and would like to get more into DSP and audio plugin development.

More info about my work is on my [website 🌐](https://www.domenicostefani.com/about.html).

I also love to play the guitar and twist knobs on synths like I know what I'm doing 🎛🎹
